# Face Enhancement Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for face enhancement, including face extraction, SRCNN-based super-resolution, and GAN-based deblurring. The project is structured to handle face images, enhance their resolution, and remove any blur, resulting in high-quality outputs.

## Overview

The pipeline processes face images through the following steps:

1. **Face Extraction**: Detects and crops faces from input images using a Haar Cascade classifier.
2. **SRCNN (Super-Resolution)**: Enhances the resolution of the cropped faces using a Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN).
3. **Deblurring**: Removes any blur from the SRCNN-enhanced images using a GAN-based model.

## Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-image
- Matplotlib

You can install all dependencies using the following command:

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/who-else-but-arjun/Doraemon.git
    cd Doraemon
    ```

2. Ensure you have the required `.h5` weight files (`generator.h5` for SRCNN and `3051crop_weight_200.h5` for the deblurring model) in the project directory.

3. Place your input images in a directory, e.g., `input_faces/`.

## Pipeline

The pipeline is outlined in the `pipeline.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, which walks through the entire process:

1. **Face Extraction**: Using `faceCrop.py`, it extracts faces from the input images.
2. **Super-Resolution with SRCNN**: Using `SRCNN.py`, it applies the SRCNN model trained on `generator.h5` weights to enhance the image resolution.
3. **Deblurring**: Using `DeblurGANv2.py`, it removes any blur from the SRCNN output using a pre-trained GAN model, with layers defined in `layer_util.py`.

## Files Description

- **`pipeline.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step process from face extraction to enhancement and deblurring.
- **`SRCNN.py`**: Implements the SRCNN model for super-resolution, loading pre-trained weights from `generator.h5`.
- **`faceCrop.py`**: Contains the Haar Cascade classifier logic for face detection and cropping.
- **`DeblurGANv2.py`**: Implements the GAN model for deblurring images, loading weights from `deblur_generator.h5`.
- **`layer_util.py`**: Contains utility functions, including ResNet blocks necessary for the deblurring model.

## How to Run

1. **Face Extraction**:

    ```bash
    python faceCrop.py --input_folder input_faces --output_folder cropped_faces
    ```

2. **SRCNN Super-Resolution**:

    ```bash
    python srcnn.py --input_folder cropped_faces --output_folder srcnn_output --weights generator.h5
    ```

3. **Deblurring**:

    ```bash
    python deblur_gan_v2.py --input_folder srcnn_output --output_folder deblurred_output --weights deblur_generator.h5
    ```

4. **Run the entire pipeline**:

    Execute all steps sequentially in the `pipeline.ipynb` notebook.

## Results

The results of the pipeline will be saved in the specified output directories. You can compare the before and after images to evaluate the improvement in image quality.
